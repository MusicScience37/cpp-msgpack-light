## Build

If you created the development environment via Devcontainer of VSCode,
you can build this repository using CMake Tools extension.

To build using command line, follow the steps below.

1. Start a shell of poetry.

   ```bash
   cd <this-directory>
   poetry install
   poetry shell
   ```

2. Download vcpkg if you haven't already.
